Since our first day in business, we set out to provide a quality product at a
reasonable price. With Ernst's extensive knowledge of lens function and Michael's
understanding of style, were able to bridge the gap between function and fashion.
What sets us apart from other optician run optical boutiques, is our clear point
of view of eye wear and our on site optical laboratory. By operating our optical
laboratory we're able to insure the quality of our work, and dispense a finished
product in a timely manner.

In the summer of 2009 we relocated to 4th Street in Berkeley.
